# Predictive-AI-for-Supply-Chain-Resilience
This project uses machine learning to **predict late deliveries in complex supply chains**, helping businesses proactively manage delays and improve logistics performance. Trained on over 180,000 supply chain transactions and 450,000 access logs, the model demonstrates how AI can support data-driven supply chain decision-making.
